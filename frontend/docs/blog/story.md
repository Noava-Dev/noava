### Listening to Teachers

The spark for Noava came from talking to teachers and understanding the challenges they face every day. At KA Halle, we noticed that teachers were already using tools like Anki for flashcards, but they had unmet needs. They wanted a platform that could go beyond basic flashcards—something flexible, student-focused, and designed specifically for educational environments.

### From Project to Vision

What started as a school project quickly became something more. Noava represents our team’s commitment to improving learning experiences through thoughtful, practical technology. It’s a reminder that the best ideas often come from listening and understanding real people’s challenges.

Even though we started this journey as students completing a final project, our hope is that Noava can continue to grow and help more teachers and students beyond our own classrooms. This project has shown us the power of collaboration, empathy, and creativity—and we’re excited to see where it goes next.
