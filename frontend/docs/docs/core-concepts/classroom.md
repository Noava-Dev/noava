# Classrooms

A **classroom** is a central space in Noava where decks can be organized and shared with a group of students. Classrooms make it easy for teachers to distribute study material and for students to access everything they need in one place.

Classrooms can contain multiple decks, allowing students to study related topics together. Teachers can add decks to a classroom, giving everyone access to the same content and creating a shared learning environment.

Classrooms also track progress for each student, including time spent studying, average mastery, number of cards reviewed, and accuracy of answers, which teachers can view on their dashboard.

Classrooms are designed to be simple to set up, manage, and use, supporting both individual study and collaborative learning while integrating seamlessly with decks and progress tracking in Noava.
