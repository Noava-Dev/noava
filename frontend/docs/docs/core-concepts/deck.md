# Decks

A **deck** is a collection of flashcards on a specific topic. Decks are the main way to organize study material in Noava, helping you focus on one subject at a time, either on your own or with friends.

Each deck contains multiple flashcards, with a front for a prompt or question and a back for the answer or explanation. Decks can be shared with other users, letting you collaborate with friends or other students. They can also be added to classrooms to support group learning, creating a central place to distribute material to students.

Decks can be reviewed in different ways, either individually or grouped into sessions and study modes such as Long-Term Write Mode or Quick Review. During Long-Term reviews, each deck also tracks your progress, including time spent studying, average mastery, number of cards reviewed, and accuracy of answers, which you can view on your dashboard.

Decks are designed to be simple to create, share, and review while forming the foundation for all study activity, classroom organization, and progress tracking in Noava.
