# Review Sessions & Modes

Noava allows you to review flashcards using different **Review Sessions** and **Review Modes**.

A **Review Session** determines which cards are included and how progress is handled.
A **Review Mode** determines how you interact with the cards during that session.

You can start a review session from the **Decks** and **Deck Detail** page:

1. Go to **Dashboard**
2. Click **Decks**
3. Open the deck you want to study
4. Choose between **Study Now** or **Quick Review**

## Review Sessions

### Quick Review

Quick Session is designed for short-term revision.

- Includes **all cards** in the selected deck
- No spaced repetition logic is applied
- No long-term statistics are tracked
- Ideal for reviewing everything before a test or exam

> This session does not affect the long-term learning progression of your cards.

---

### Long-Term Review

Study Now is the main long-term learning session in Noava.

- Includes only cards that are **due**
- Based on the Leitner-Box system
- Card progression updates based on your answers
- Designed for structured daily learning

> This is the recommended way to study if your goal is long-term retention.

---

### Bulk Review

Bulk Session extends Quick Review across multiple decks.

- Select multiple decks
- Includes all cards from the selected decks
- No spaced repetition logic
- No long-term tracking

> This is useful when you want to revise content from several decks in one sitting.

---

## Review Modes

Quick Session and Study Now Session both support the following Review Modes.

**Important:**

> Marking a card as **Correct** or **Incorrect** is only available in **Long-Term Review**. Quick and Bulk Reviews do not affect progress and can therefore not be marked.

### Flip Mode

Flip Mode follows the classic flashcard format.

1. View the front of the card
2. Flip the card to reveal the answer

> This is the fastest and most straightforward way to review.

---

### Write Mode

Write Mode focuses on active recall.

1. The prompt is shown
2. You type your answer
3. The system evaluates your response

You can manually override the result, if needed, in cases where small variations should still count as correct.
For example:

- "La porte"
- "Une porte"

> Write Mode is our recommended way to study.

---

### Reverse Mode

Reverse Mode works like Flip Mode, but in the opposite direction.

1. View the back of the card
2. Flip the card to reveal the answer

> This mode is especially useful for learning languages in both directions.

## Choosing the Right Setup

Noava offers flexibility in how you study, but here are our recommendations:

**Long-Term Review + Write Mode:**

- This is our **recommended way to study**. It enforces active recall by requiring you to actively write your answers, which goes hand-in-hand with long-term retention.

**Quick Review + Flip Mode:**

- As the name suggests, this is best for a quick revision when you want to go through all cards, such as before a test or exam.

**Reverse Mode:**

- We believe this is particularly useful for language learning, allowing you to practice in both directions.
