# Start a Review

Once you have created a deck or added one to a classroom, you can start reviewing cards to track your progress.

## Steps

1. Click on the deck you created earlier.

2. Click **Study Now** in the top left.

3. Choose the **Long-Term Write** mode. This is a long-term review session where you write the answers to each card.

5. You can override and mark the card as **Correct** or **Incorrect**.

   - Or click the more options menu in the top-right of the deck card and select **Analytics**.
